# CreatorofNeurals
Creates instances of simple neural networks based on the parameters provided.
Parametrs are: 
>Layer data in the form of a list 
>Input layer
ip():- takes in data for the input layer in the form of a list containg numbers
compute():- computes the final(output) layer of the neural network.
enter():- takes in a list containing numpy arrays, where list[0] is the list containing lists of weights for each layer where each list of weights (with index n) corresponds to the n + 1th layer in the list containing the layers and list[1] is the list containg the biases for each link.
exunt():- outputs a list containg the weights for each link.

This was my second try at hacking together a neural network, so expect inefficencies.
